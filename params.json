  "body": "MPD - Multiplex PCR Design\r\n============================\r\n\r\nby Thomas Wingo and David Cutler\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nMPD is a program designed to automate creation of multiplex primer design written in C. The `mpd_lessGreedy` and `mpd_moreGreedy` binaries differ in which primer pool they choose to start with for pool creation. Either binary can be used as stand-alone or in conjunction with the [MPD perl package](http://github.com/wingolab-org/mpd-perl).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n- Clone the repository\r\n- Make with `make all`\r\n- Binaries will be compiled and saved to the `build` directory\r\n\r\n## Required files\r\n- You will need a hashed copy of the genome to run the primer software.\r\n- Instructions below show how you can create one yourself. A prebuild hg38 genome with flat dbSnp files is available from [this repository](https://bitbucket.org/wingolab/mpd-dat/). It may be cloned like so, `git clone https://bitbucket.org/wingolab/mpd-dat.git`. \r\n\r\n### Build Hashed Genome\r\n- Download the genome of interest as a fasta file\r\n- Use `bin/run_index.pl`, which creates a sh script to run `index_genome`\r\n\r\n### Flat dbSnp\r\n- Download and decompress the flat files for variant sites that should be avoided when designing primers. For instance, dbSNP maintains a list for most organisms and you will find the proper format in the `ASN1_flat` directory. The human data is located here: `ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/organisms/human_9606_b146_GRCh38p2/ASN1_flat/`.\r\n- Prepare a `sdx` file that contains the number of chromsome files to include as the 1st line and then a list of the names of all chromosome files. On the command line you might try: `ls -1 *.line | wc -l > db_flat.sdx; ls -1 >> db_flat.sdx`. Note that the sdx should be in the same order that the chromsomes are in for the indexed genome. See the genome's sdx file (e.g., `cat hg38.d14.sdx`) to see the order.\r\n\r\n##  Run mpd\r\n- The easiest way of using MPD is to use the [Perl pacakge MPD](http://github.com/wingolab-org/mpd-perl), but either `mpd_lessGreedy` and `mpd_moreGreedy` binaries may be executed from the command line interactively.\r\n",
